## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Usage

### Packages 

[MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages were used to connect Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package used environment variables to store sensitive data.


### Seed the Database

The `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to creates the database with MySQL shell commands. Run `npm run seed` to seed data to the database.


### Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start

Use `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
